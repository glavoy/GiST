rangeCheck - changed this for only range - can add other checks like possible values


Specify all the question types in the xml file:
	radio
	checkbox
	text
	automatic
	information
	
	
fieldtype:
	integer - text_integer, phone_num
	decimal - text_decimal
	text


	
Numeric check (note name cahanged to 'numericCheck' from 'numeric_check'), also do not need 'value' child node:
	minvalue - minimum vaue of number range
	maxvalue - maximum vaue of number range
	other_values - anotehr value than may be acceptable, but not in the range (can be a many values, separated by a comma)
	message - Error message when number is not within range
	
	
post skip:
	fieldname - value from the current question 
	condition -  = '&lt;&gt;' list all
	response - value to check; if response_type = fixed, then hard code value; if response_type is dynamic, enter the fieldname to get the value
	response_type - fixed, then hard code response; dynamic, then enter fieldname to get the value
	skiptofieldname - fieldname to skip to
	
	
Special buttons:
	- do not need a value in the xml file - hard coded in the Survey.cs file
	
XML file must begin with:
	<survey version ='2020.10.02' name='gist'>
	
	
Data:
	- version will be saved on a single line, followed immediately by all the field names for that version on the next line
	- will check if version exists when beginning a new survey - if not, write the version and field names
	- if
